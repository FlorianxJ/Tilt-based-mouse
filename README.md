The Cad model is a work in progess one it was NOT tested. It is not finished and is meant to be an inspiration.
The code uses the libary of Hykudoru to comunicate with the BMI 160 it is found under this link: https://github.com/Hykudoru/Pescado-Engine-Embedded-ESP32S3
You are free to use the code and CAD model as well as the wiring diagram but do not send me any requests or complaints.
This as well as any other projekt i commit here are purely a hobby and will not be maintained.
Use at your own risk.
